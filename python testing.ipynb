       "  'language': 'en',\n",
       "  'text': 'I last profiled The Trade Desk (TTD) on May 20 in our weekly Top Picks video after the company had reported a strong \"beat and raise\" first quarter and the stock fell back from all-time highs above $230 to an attractive consolidation zone between $195 and $205. \\xa0 I was pounding the table then about the true disruption this $10 billion digital advertising David was creating amidst the Goliaths Facebook and Google.\\xa0 \\xa0 Why? Not just because they are disrupting a $750 billion global advertising market. And not just because they just entered the largest single-language consumer market in the world, China, with over 500 million people using their mobile phones to search, shop, and engage content. \\xa0 But precisely because The Trade Desk is a next generation advertising platform that allows marketers precision access to billions of consumers using hundreds of websites, apps, web-connected TV channels and other digital content providers like streaming music sites that slip ads into the experience. \\xa0 In other words, while Google and Facebook are giant \"walled gardens\" for advertisers to experiment in, they are not the entire universe of possible locations where companies can find their potential consumers. \\xa0 Plus, The Trade Desk has capitalized on the same type of data-driven technology that the giants use to target specific audiences and then give ad buyers detailed information on which customers made a purchase based on which of their ads. This attribution data is the lifeblood of the digital advertiser. \\xa0 What\\'s more, The Trade Desk technology gives advertisers all of this information and access in a real-time \"mission control\" platform that allows two important functions: \\xa0 (1) consumer behavior data and research across digital media \"channels\" and verticals to obtain precision targeting; and \\xa0 (2) complete automation of ad-buying programs that can participate in virtually unlimited auctions -- lasting just 1/10th of a second -- for omnichannel advertising \"real estate\" that suits their requirements and audiences. \\xa0 Advertising Goes Algo \\xa0 This \"programmatic\" ad-buying auction is why you now see static ads changing every 30 seconds on your favorite websites. And The Trade Desk says that \"Even media that isn\\'t digital will be transacted digitally, using the internet.\" \\xa0 CEO Jeff Green even compares their platform to the modern stock exchange where automated algorithms are responsible for over 70% of the trading volume.\\xa0 \\xa0 As you may know, the real-time, global, electronic auctions that have become our security exchanges are powered by lightning-fast fiber optics and high-powered servers -- and they are largely responsible for increased liquidity via tighter bid/ask spreads and depth, supported by the speed of computers which can control risk on bigger size. \\xa0 This \"price discovery\" auction process is as old as the first futures exchanges in Chicago over 150 years ago and has always relied on a multitude of diverse participants coming together in one place and each voting for their own idea of value. \\xa0 Thus, the modern programmatic ad auction becomes the centralized market place for the discovery of advertising value and thereby delivers the central answer being sought: what is an ad really worth? \\xa0 The Linchpin: The Marketing Agency \\xa0 \"Ads are the currency of the internet. Ads are the currency of nearly all media.\" - Jeff Green, CEO of The Trade Desk \\xa0 While advertisers can access The Trade Desk platform directly, the classic middle-man in the industry remains important. In fact, the modern ad agency is being transformed by this data-driven revolution as they no longer have to guess what will work and everything can be tested in real-time. \\xa0 The days of \"creative\" departments pitching ideas that may or may not work with a broad audience, but can\\'t be tracked and measured, are over. Today, there is a deluge of data about customer behavior and purchasing being recorded on the web and elsewhere and all this information is available to savvy marketers. \\xa0 Through a self-service, cloud-based platform, ad buyers can create, manage and optimize data-driven digital advertising campaigns for their clients, including display, video, audio, native and social, and all on a multitude of devices. And they can set up ad buying and placement programs to run automatically to \"chase\" target audiences across the omnichannel jungle of content providers, placing ads in front of the right people, in the right place, at the right time -- and all with attribution data that is tracked to let them know what worked and what didn\\'t.\\xa0 Going Algo Means Going AI Here\\'s what my colleague Ben Rains wrote about the company\\'s latest innovation on May 22... TTD rolled out its own AI technology it calls Koa last summer to help automatically surface data-driven recommendations in real-time to improve ad campaigns. The process allows customers to get a more market-driven price on their ads, reach the right target audience on the right devices, and more. In the end, non-ad supported services such as Netflix (NFLX ), Amazon Prime (AMZN ), Spotify (SPOT), and soon enough Disney (DIS ) and Apple (AAPL), have made consumers harder to reach. Therefore, companies big and small need a more modern, data-driven way to advertise, and The Trade Desk seems poised to benefit from these needs. Investors should also note that The Trade Desk recently launched a programmatic ad buying platform in China. The firm also said that its newer connected TV and audio channels “grew multiples faster” than its more mature units, which is a good sign as smart TVs from the likes of Roku (ROKU ) and digital audio and podcasts proliferate. On top of that, The Trade Desk boasted that its customer retention rate remained over 95% during Q1, “as it has for the previous 21 quarters.” The OTT World of Connected TV When advertisers circumvent traditional ad-buying and placement channels with networks and cable to get their commercials onto TV shows using the internet, it\\'s call \"over the top,\" or OTT. Initially named in reference to devices that go “over” a cable box to give the user access to TV content, OTT advertising is also delivered via an internet connection rather than through a traditional cable/broadcast provider. This is probably one of the biggest new markets for The Trade Desk. Here\\' how the company describes the opportunity for advertisers... What if you could get all the benefits of advertising on TV, but with more control over who sees your ads and how often? With Connected TV (CTV), you can serve up your ads at the right time, the right number of times – so your audience doesn’t tune out. Plus, get real-time results that help you optimize campaigns faster. Technology has changed the way people watch TV. Now we’re changing the way you reach audiences with your ads. CTV brings the advantages of programmatic to TV advertising, helping you connect with a highly engaged audience wherever they’re watching.\\xa0 And here are the primary benefits The Trade Desk sees its platform being able to deliver to OTT advertisers... Data-driven targeting. Use first and third-party data to reach your most valuable audiences on every screen -– just like with your digital campaigns. Better measurement. Track the impact of your CTV campaigns with digital and traditional metrics, including video completion rates and gross rating points. Smarter retargeting. Re-engage viewers within households across streaming devices, computers, tablets, and mobile phones. Premium inventory. Run your ads alongside popular TV shows and movies, in front of an audience that’s fully invested. What About the Valuation? With this year\\'s revenue projected to hit $650 million, representing 36% growth, this $10.25 billion company is trading for over 15 times sales. That\\'s not cheap, but it\\'s also not out of line with many young software high-fliers like Veeva Systems (VEEV) or Shopify (SHOP) that have high margins and are growing revenues between 30% and 50%. And since The Trade Desk doesn\\'t create content or sell products, it\\'s never in competition with any platform, marketer, or retailer. It is merely the exchange for hundreds of ad brokers and thousands of companies to get the right ads at the best price. That\\'s why going into China right now, as a partner to Baidu, Alibaba (BABA), and Tencent makes so much sense. As CEO Jeff Green put it recently on Mad Money, they approached China as a business developer looking to facilitate ad spend and commerce for their biggest brands, not merely to tap the Chinese consumer and take money out of the country. Finally, The Trade Desk has some of the highest margins in all of software and the company is projected to grow the bottom line to $3.60 EPS next year for over a 20% advance. I would be a long-term buyer of TTD shares on pullbacks under $220. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.

       "  'text': 'Wien (www.aktiencheck.de) - Zum Wochenausklang stand neben dem viel beachteten G20-Gipfel auch der zweite Teil des jährlichen US-Stresstests für Finanzkonzerne im Fokus der Anleger, so die Analysten der Raiffeisen Bank International AG. Dabei habe allen voran Deutsche Bank (ISIN: DE0005140008, WKN: 514000, Ticker-Symbol: DBK, NYSE-Symbol: DB) hervorstechen können und habe zu Handelsende 3,3% im Plus gelegen. Sei die Bank in den vergangenen Jahren mit ihrem US-Geschäft dreimal bei der Prüfung durchgefallen, so habe es diesmal seitens der FED keine Einwände gegen die Kapitalpläne des DAX (ISIN: DE0008469008, WKN: 846900)-Konzerns gegeben. Darüber hinaus seien Gerüchte aufgekommen, wonach sich der Konzern von bis zu einem Fünftel seiner aktuellen Belegschaft trennen könnte. Auch alle anderen zur Teilnahme verpflichteten Institute hätten grünes Licht erhalten, Credit Suisse (ISIN: CH0012138530, WKN: 876800, Ticker-Symbol: CSX, SIX Swiss Ex: CSGN, Nasdaq OTC-Symbol: CSGKF) allerdings nur unter Auflagen. Daraufhin hätten Goldman Sachs (ISIN: US38141G1040, WKN: 920332, Ticker-Symbol: GOS, NYSE-Symbol: GS) um 2,6%, JP Morgan (ISIN: US46625H1005, WKN: 850628, Ticker-Symbol: CMC, NYSE-Symbol: JPM) um 2,7%, Bank of America (ISIN: US0605051046, WKN: 858388, Ticker-Symbol: NCB, NYSE-Symbol: BAC) um 2,8% und Citigroup (ISIN: US1729674242, WKN: A1H92V, Ticker-Symbol: TRVC, NYSE-Symbol: C) um 2,8% zulegen können.

(ISIN: US0378331005, WKN: 865985, Ticker-Symbol: APC, Nasdaq-Symbol: AAPL) zu halten. Schwache Endmärkte, eine deutliche Abkühlung der Nachfragedynamik, nicht zuletzt durch den Handelsstreit zwischen den USA und China befeuert, sowie Konjunktursorgen würden die Branchenstimmung belasten. Mit einem Absatzrückgang um 3,0% (gemaß IDC) habe der PC-Markt einen schwachen Jahresstart hingelegt. Im Vorfeld des Supportablaufs für Windows 7 liefere der Ersatzzyklus im kommerziellen Sektor Wachstum. Bremswirkung hätten Lieferengpässe bei Intel-Prozessoren entfaltet, welche sich jedoch im weiteren Jahresverlauf abschwächen würden. Gartner und IDC hätten sich deutlich in den Angaben zum Rückgang des weltweiten Smartphone-Absatzes (2,7% und 6,6%) unterschieden. Besonders hohe Diskrepanzen hätten bei den Zahlen zu Apple geherrscht. Erlöse mit iPhones seien nach Konzernangaben um 17,3% auf USD 31,05 Mrd. eingeknickt. Je nach Quelle sei der Einbruch der Absatzmenge auf 16% bis 30% geschätzt worden. Apple liefere seit dem laufenden Geschäftsjahr keine Daten zu Absatzmengen und Durchschnittspreisen. In der Region Greater China seien die Konzernerlöse eingebrochen, um 21,5% bzw. USD 2,81 Mrd. Der Handelsstreit zwischen den USA und China habe sich inzwischen deutlich in einer Marktabschwächung manifestiert. Entspannungssignale könnte ein positiver Ausgang der Gespräche zwischen Donald Trump und Xi Jinping im Rahmen des G20-Gipfels in Osaka senden.

       "  'text': 'München (www.aktiencheck.de) - Apple: Die Spekulationen haben ein Ende - Übernahme von Drive.ai bestätigt! Aktienanalyse Die Spekulationen über die Übernahme des Roboterauto-Start-up Drive.ai gab es schon länger, jetzt hat Apple (ISIN: US0378331005, WKN: 865985, Ticker-Symbol: APC, Nasdaq-Symbol: AAPL) diese gegenüber dem US-Businessmagazin Axios bestätigt, so die Bank Vontobel Europe AG in einer aktuellen Veröffentlichung. Das Start-up aus dem Silicon Valley arbeite bereits seit 2015 an einer Software für das autonome Fahren. Vor zwei Jahren sei das Unternehmen nach der zweiten Finanzierungsrunde mit über 200 Mio. USD bewertet worden. Zuletzt habe Drive.ai in finanziellen Schwierigkeiten gesteckt, deshalb habe man seit Februar nach neuen Geldgebern gesucht. Informationen über den Kaufpreis seien nicht veröffentlicht worden, das Technologie Magazin \"The Information\" gehe davon aus, dass der Kaufpreis unter den 77 Mio. USD gelegen habe, den Drive.ai in seiner ersten Finanzierungsrunde an Wagniskapital eingesammelt habe. Die Übernahme könne als Bekräftigung von Apples Ambitionen im Bereich des autonomen Fahrens gesehen werden. Das Roboterautoprojekt des Konzerns trage den Namen \"Project Titan\". Anfang des Jahres seien Informationen über eine Neuausrichtung des Projektes und die Entlassung von fast 200 Ingenieuren bekannt geworden. Es habe schon Stimmen gegeben, die gesagt hätten, dass Apple den Anschluss gegenüber anderen Unternehmen, die in diesem Bereich forschen würden, wie Googles Waymo, Tesla oder den deutschen Autoherstellern, verlieren könnte. Apple habe einige Ingenieure und Produkt Designer aus dem Start-up eingestellt und erhoffe sich so Know-How zu gewinnen. Drive.ai sei auf Künstliche Intelligenz spezialisiert, welche die Software für selbstfahrende Autos verbessere. Zuletzt habe \"Project Titan\" laut Branchen Insidern \"rapide\" Fortschritte gemacht, diese würden sich auf die Berichte zu getesteten Prototypen in Kalifornien berufen. Apples Flotte von modifizierten Lexus sei in den letzten beiden Jahren ca. 80.000 Meilen autonom, auf den öffentlichen Straßen Kaliforniens gefahren. Verglichen mit Konkurrenten in diesem Feld sei das viel. Das offizielle Ziel des Projektes sei nicht bekannt. Während ein Übernahmeangebot an Tesla im Jahr 2013 auf die Produktion von eigenen autonom fahrenden PKW schließen lasse, würden die Tests eher nahe legen, dass man nur die Software liefern möchte. Die Übernahme zeige wieder, dass das Ziel voll autonomes Fahren zu ermöglichen ohne Übernahmen und Kooperationen kaum bewältigt werden könne. Daniel Göhring vom Dahlem Center für Maschinelles Lernen und Robotik sage, \"Übernahmen von Start-ups im Bereich des autonomen Fahrens finden schon seit vielen Jahren statt\". Dieses Phänomen lasse sich weltweit beobachten, im März dieses Jahres habe zum Beispiel Daimler Trucks Mehrheitsanteile an Torc Robotics, einem Softwareanbieter für hochautomatisierte Lkw erworben. Wie diese Beispiele zeigen würden, sei der Markt stark umkämpft. Durch Kooperationen und Übernahmen würden große Player versuchen, sich die Vorherrschaft im autonomen Fahren zu sichern. Die Analysten der UBS hätten zuletzt eine Schätzung abgegeben, in der sie den Markt auf ein Volumen von mehreren Billionen Dollar schätzen würden. Allein der Markt für Robo-Taxis solle bis 2030 ein Volumen von über 2 Billionen Dollar haben. Die Übernahme von Drive.ai unterstreicht Apples würden bestreben die Abhängigkeit vom iPhone mit Hilfe von neuen Geschäftsfeldern zu verringern. Durch Rückgänge bei den Verkäufen von iPhones und Macs habe die Vorstellung der letzten Quartalszahlen bei Anlegern zunächst für Unsicherheit gesorgt. Dennoch habe sich Apples Oberhaupt Tim Cook zuversichtlich im Rahmen des Aktienrückkaufprogramms und den übertroffenen Analystenerwartungen gezeigt. Auch die schwächelnden iPhone-Absatzzahlen halte der CEO für bereits überwundene Probleme. Mit Preissenkungen und Rückkauf-Programmen alter iPhone-Geräte werde in Zukunft, in China bereits heute, die aktuelle iPhone-Krise gelöst werden. Auch die steigende Nachfrage nach anderen Produkten, wie Apples iPads und der Apple Watch könnten zunehmen. Außerdem würden die Umsätze in der Service Sparte zunehmen und die Expansion des Streaming Dienstes Apple Music sei in vollem Gange. Es bleibe spannend wie sich \"Project Titan\" weiterentwickle und ob vielleicht auch andere Dienste wie die Karten App oder VR-Anwendungen von dem Know-How profitieren würden. Im September werde wieder die Keynote stattfinden, vielleicht gebe es neben neuen iPhones und der Apple Watch Series 5 auch etwas ganz Neues. Die Apple-Aktie notiert aktuell bei USD 199,80 (27.06.2019), so die Bank Vontobel Europe AG. Das 52-Wochen hoch habe bei USD 233,47 (03.10.2018), das 52-Wochen tief bei USD 142,00 (03.01.2019) gelegen.

       "  'title': 'The Biggest Apple Stories Of 2013 [Year In Review] | Cult of Mac',\n",
       "  'language': 'en',\n",
       "  'text': '2013 was an enormous year for Apple. \\xa0Yes, there were hyped keynotes galore, fabulous new products, record breaking sales, and much, much more. But 2013 was about more than just hardware for Apple Inc. During Tim Cook’s second full-year reigning over Apple we saw the CEO really settle into his role helming the largest tech company in the world while Jony Ive’s influence grew to greater heights than in the Jobs-era as he spread his design tentacles from hardware to software. Jony and Tim weren’t the only stars of 2013 though. There was the up-and-coming VP of software engineering Craig Federighi and Craig Federighi’s Hair, while Apple’s hiring of Burberry CEO Angela Ahrendts received heaps of praise from both the financial, tech, and fashion markets.\\xa0Oh and don’t forget about\\xa0goons like David Einhorn, Carl Icahn and even cranky old John McCain getting their jabs in at Apple throughout the year. Here’s Cult of Mac’s look back on Apple in the year 2013: Starting the year off right, Apple announced its best earning ever for Q1 2013.\\xa0Apple announced earnings of $54.5 billion and a net profit of $13.1 billion. But the stock took a tumble for months as Wall Street worried that Apple’s phenomenal growth slowing. Don’t you love how a record-breaking quarter is still considered an “ouch?” While investors worried about Apple not growing anymore, rumors began to circulate that the company was working on a $99 iPhone. As iPhone 5 sales were beginning to drop, many investors saw enormous potential in the idea of an unsubsidized $99 iPhone. The WSJ said it would be released by the end of 2013, but when Apple finally announced the iPhone 5c in the Fall the price tag was more than fans were hoping for. China became a huge focus for Apple in 2013 with Tim Cook making his second to the country\\xa0in January to talk to country officials and meet with China Mobile.\\xa0Cook also addressed Apple employees \\xa0at a staff meeting at the end of January to comment on Apple’s falling stock price, saying that the company is focused on mindshare, not marketshare, a point which he reiterated to the media throughout the year. iWatch rumors were all the rage in February after the NYT and WSJ both reported that Apple has dedicated a team of over 100 designers to making a smartwatch. The iWatch will presumably use Bluetooth 4.0 to connect with an iPhone and show incoming messages to act as a bridge between your devices, though we haven’t heard anything official from Cupertino on it yet.\\xa0 Debate surrounding Apple’s stock intensified in February thanks to Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn who demanded Apple start selling iPref stock\\xa0and even went so far as suing the company. Einhorn’s plan called for Apple should distribute $47 billion in preferred\\xa0stock to fixed-income investors, and call it iPrefs. The iPrefs shares would issue 50 cents per quarter in dividends indefinitely so that investors can get higher yields out of Apple’s stock and get a piece of the more than $100 billion in cash Apple has in the bank. Tim Cook denounced the entire episode as “a silly sideshow” while speaking at Goldman Sach’s annual tech conference. Word of Jony Ive’s growing influence at Apple started to buzz as iWatch rumors grew along with a big iOS 7 redesign in the pipeline. As the new Human Interface designer, Ive planned to apply his hardware design philosophies to software by stripping iOS down to flat, modern, white spaces. The absence of Forstall also led improved collaboration between Ive and human interface lead Greg Christie, known for his bluntness, with insiders describing the relationship as “pleasant and cordial.” Apple’s mapping efforts were the butt of all the tech jokes toward the end of 2012 thanks to the disastrous launch of its new maps app in iOS 6. \\xa0Looking to quickly make up lost ground, Apple acquired WifiSlam, an indoor mapping company that developed ways\\xa0for mobile apps to detect a phone user’s location in a building using Wi-Fi signals, paving the way for iBeacons to launch in iOS 7 later in the year. Controversy surrounding cell phone unlocking came into the national spotlight thanks to a petition with 114,000+ signatures demanding the ability to unlock their iPhone without risking criminal penalties. President Obama came out in favor of legalizing unlocking and released a statement claiming consumers should be able to use their iPhones on another network if the devices has been paid for and the consumer\\xa0and isn’t bound by a service agreement or other obligation. Rumors of Apple’s plan for iTunes Radio started heating up alongside whispers that the iPhone 5s will have a fingerprint sensor.\\xa0Samsung revealed its answer for the iPhone 5 with the Galaxy S 4 and all its gimmicky features, but Apple still managed to capture its 9th straight J.D. Power award for the iPhone. After getting pounded by the Chinese media for its warranty policies, Tim Cook started April off by publishing a letter apologizing to customers in China.\\xa0The letter, which was written in Chinese and posted to Apple’s\\xa0website, said that Tim Cook and the rest of the company have been reflecting on the feedback regarding its\\xa0warranty\\xa0policies\\xa0so that a repaired iPhone 4 or iPhone 4S will be covered under warranty for one year after it’s been repaired. Apple released its financial results for the second fiscal quarter of 2013 that beat estimates with a reported\\xa0$43.6 billion in revenue and a net profit of $9.5 billion, however profit shrank year-over-year for the first time in ten years, sending AAPL shares on another slide. Rear casing for the iPhone 5c started making their appearance on the Internet in April partnered with new rumors that Apple would break from tradition and release two new iPhone units this year. Tim Cook fanned the flames more by teasing Apple’s upcoming product line for 2013 with vague hints during the quarterly earnings call. WWDC was also announced during April, but getting tickets was about as hard as winning the lottery as the event sold out in 71 seconds.\\xa0 \\xa0 With WWDC on the horizon, Apple’s software engineers were put into “crunch time” mode to get iOS 7 ready in time for developers to appreciate the sweeping changes Jony Ive was rumored to bring to the OS. Tim Cook headed to Washington D.C. to explain the why’s and how’s of Apple’s massive offshore cash horde before the Senate Sub-Committee Hearing to Examine Offshore Profit Shifting and Tax Avoidance by Apple Inc. Cook managed to appease Senator McCain and his frustration over having to update his apps. The App Store celebrated its 50 billionth download, and after 86 bids sent Tim Cook’s CharityBuzz into the stratosphere, some crazy bastard walked away paying $610,000 in the charity auction just to sip some coffee with Timmy at Apple HQ. Apple went the entire first half of the year without announcing a single new product until the keynote at WWDC. After Scott Forstall was outed as VP of iOS Software Design,\\xa0Jony Ive redesign the entire system by stripping out the heavy textures, shadowing, and skeuomorphic features, in favor of a flatter, white interface. iOS 7 also featured a number of important software features, such as iBeacons and native support for third-party controllers for the first time ever. iTunes Radio was announced at the event as the company’s answer to Pandora. Apple didn’t announce any new iDevices, but it did sign a $30 million iPad contract with the 2nd largest school district in the nation. OS X 10.9 was previewed at WWDC as Apple announced they were ditching their cat-themed names in favor of California-inspired names with the debut of Mavericks. The update featured big improvements to Safari, notifications, Maps for OS X, and iCloud keychain. MacBook Airs were also shown off at WWDC with all-day battery life thanks to Intel’s new Haswell processors. The new machines featured 2X GPU execution units 40% faster graphics and 45% faster SSDs. A trailer for the new Mac Pro was also shown during Phil Schiller’s segment of the keynote, but in a rare Apple move, pricing and a launch date weren’t immediately available. A new Airport, Airport Express and Time Capsule were also announced at the event. Fashion CEOs were all the rage when it came to new Apple hires this year, starting in July when the company nabbed Paul Deneve,\\xa0former Yves Saint Laurent CEO. Deneve was hired as a vice president and will be working on special projects – probably something related to iWatch – reporting directly to Tim Cook. A Hulu exec was also hired to help negotiate ad deals for Apple TV. During its earnings call for the third fiscal quarter, the company was just barely able to beat Wall Street’s estimates by\\xa0reporting revenue of $35.3 billion and a net profit of $6.9 billion, aided by the sale of 31.2 million iPhone (a Q3 record).\\xa0 News of the NSA’s PRISM program rocked the country when it was revealed that NSA created a $20 million spy program, that has been allowed to directly access citizens’ private data on Microsoft,\\xa0Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube, and Apple servers – the companies joined the program in that order as well. All companies denied involvement in PRISM initial, but by July\\xa0Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter and others formed a broad alliance with civil liberties groups to demand for increased transparency regarding the U.S. government’s spy programs on citizens. Apple unveiled a redesigned Logic Pro X at the end of the month and it also managed to work out a settlement with Amazon over the use of the phrase “App store” before their trial went to court. By the end of the month the iPhone 5c had practically been officially confirmed thanks to a Pegatron labor abuse report. \\xa0 \\xa0 As rumors regarding the\\xa0mythical gold iPhone started to heat up, Ashton Kutcher brought his sexy smolder to the Steve Jobs death stare with\\xa0the wide-release of\\xa0JOBS, the first biopic of Steve Jobs since his death in 2011. The film’s release was pushed back from April after received\\xa0mixed reviews\\xa0during its screening at Sundance. The film only brought in $6.7 million its opening weekend, although the actor did share some deep insights into how he stepped into the role of Jobs. Carl Icahn emerged as Tim Cook’s latest nuances regarding AAPL shares and a stock buyback program. The famous billionaire investor took to Twitter to proclaim the stock as being “extremely undervalued.” AAPL shares subsequently shot up and the two later met to discuss the stock over dinner, but Icahn has been pestering Cook and Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer to do a large buyback sooner rather than later. President Obama hosted a meeting with Tim Cook,\\xa0AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, Google computer scientist Vint Cerf and other tech executives and civil liberties leaders for a closed-door meeting about government surveillance.\\xa0Those off-the-record discussions centered on the controversy surrounding the NSA as well as commercial privacy issues such as online tracking of consumers as Apple and other tech companies have pushed for more transparency over how often the NSA request private data. \\xa0 Months of speculation and rumors surrounding the iPhone finally culminated with the September 10th keynote where Tim Cook and the gang revealed not one, but two new iPhones – the iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s. The iPhone 5s included new features like Touch ID, a 64-bit A7 processor, the M7 motion co-processor, an improved camera with dual led flash, while the iPhone 5c was a cheaper plastic version of the popular iPhone 5. Jony Ive announced that he and famed designer Marc Newson were teaming up to create aone-of-a-kind auction blockof items – including solid gold ear pods, a custom Leica, red Mac Proand more – to benefit Bono’s Project (RED) charity to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in Africa.\\xa0 iOS 7 was launched publicly on September 18th while Apple enjoyed its most successful iPhone launch weekend with over 9 million units sold. To compete against Google Docs and Microsoft Office, Apple announced that it was making its iWork suite of apps free to new Mac and iDevice owners. The iMac finally got an update at the end of September to include\\xa0fourth-generation Intel quad-core Haswell processors,NVIDIA GeForce 700 series graphics, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and faster PCIe\\xa0flash\\xa0storage\\xa0options were added to the popular all-in-one desktop. Apple went nearly a year before replacing its failed Retail Chief, John Browett, but the company made a huge splash by announcing Angela Ahrendts, CEO of Burberry, will be joining the Cupertino company to take up a newly-created position as senior vice president of retail\\xa0and online stores. Ahrendts will report directly to CEO Tim Cook and will oversee the strategic direction, expansion, and\\xa0operation\\xa0of Apple’s retail business. It’s suspected that Ahrendts is being groomed to become CEO after her amazing work turning around the Burberry brand. Following the success of the iPhone event, Apple also announced two new iPads in October – iPad Air and iPad mini with Retina display. At 7.5 mm\\xa0thick and one pound in weight, the iPad Air also packed enough battery for 10 hours of use with the new A7 processor, improved camera, dual mics, and M7 coprocessor. The iPad mini with Retina display was announced with a resolution of\\xa02048 X 1536 for it’s 7.9-inch screen, but manufacturing issues caused supply constraints for the first several weeks of availability in November. Mavericks was released on October 22nd, but Apple shocked us by making it the first ever free OS X upgrade for users on Snow Leopard or later. The new Mac Pro was also officially announced at the iPad keynote with starting price of $2999, while the MacBook Pro with Retina display got beefed up with faster graphics and longer battery life. At the end of the month Apple announced \\xa0just announced its Q4 2013 earning of $36 billion in revenue with $8.2 billion in net profit. Along with the 9 million iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c units it sold during launch weekend, Apple says it sold 33.8 million iPhones, along with 14.1 million iPads – both an improvement from the same quarter last year Despite winning its $1 billion case against Samsung in 2012, the two companies went back to court this year for a retrial that saw Apple coming out on top, again. This time the jury ordered Samsung to pay Apple an extra $290 million for patent infringement damages, but the legal war is still far from over. Tim Cook took to the\\xa0The Wall Street Journal\\xa0to write an op-ed arguing in favor of the\\xa0Employment Nondiscrimination Act, a proposed piece of U.S.\\xa0legislation that protects against sexual identity and gender discrimination in the workplace. Cook occasionally gives media interviews, but him writing something like an op-ed out from under the umbrella of Apple was pretty significant. Apple continued to push back against the NSA by publishing a report\\xa0outlining the different kind of government requests it has received for its customers’ personal data. The report breaks down the number of customer account and device requests from different governments around the world, and the U.S. unsurprisingly leads the pack with the number of requests for each area. PrimeSense,\\xa0the Israel-based company behind the 3D motion tracking in the original Xbox Kinect, was scooped up by Apple for a whopping $345 million. It was the largest of many acquisitions Apple made in 2013\\xa0leading many to speculate how Apple might implement the company’s full-body motion tracking into its products. The iPad mini with Retina display finally went on sale in November, but thanks to insane demand coupled with manufacturing problems, supplies were hard to find until mid-December. Oh, and some British dude published the first biography on Jony Ive. Apple Stores across the U.S. received their biggest upgrade at the end of the year as the company activated iBeacons at 254 stores.\\xa0The iBeacons\\xa0use Bluetooth low-energy, to track users’ iPhones as they roam the store and then send notifications to users alerting them to deals or info regarding products, but we found the experience to be lacking. Nearly six months after teasing the new Mac Pro at WWDC units finally go onsale on Apple.com but shipping estimates quickly slipped into early 2014 for the new mega-computer.\\xa0Not satisfied with its huge PrimeSense buy, the company with more money than god also decided to splurge on the social media analytics company Topsy for over $200 million. And to top off the year, Tim Cook and the crew at Cupertino managed to finally managed to pull in their white whale – a contract with China Mobile. Armed with a cheaper iPhone 5c, Apple finally has access to the world’s largest carrier and the 760 million subscribers that come with it, setting up 2014 to potentially be the most lucrative year Apple has ever seen. \\xa0 image via: Camillo Miller',\n",

But 2013 was about more than just hardware for Apple Inc. During Tim Cook’s second full-year reigning over Apple we saw the CEO really settle into his role helming the largest tech company in the world while Jony Ive’s influence grew to greater heights than in the Jobs-era as he spread his design tentacles from hardware to software. </p> \\n<p>Jony and Tim weren’t the only stars of 2013 though. There was the up-and-coming VP of software engineering Craig Federighi and Craig Federighi’s Hair, while Apple’s hiring of Burberry CEO Angela Ahrendts received heaps of praise from both the financial, tech, and fashion markets.&nbsp;Oh and don’t forget about&nbsp;goons like David Einhorn, Carl Icahn and even cranky old John McCain getting their jabs in at Apple throughout the year.</p> \\n<p> Here’s Cult of Mac’s look back on Apple in the year 2013:</p> \\n<p> Starting the year off right, Apple announced its best earning ever for Q1 2013.&nbsp;Apple announced earnings of $54.5 billion and a net profit of $13.1 billion. But the stock took a tumble for months as Wall Street worried that Apple’s phenomenal growth slowing. Don’t you love how a record-breaking quarter is still considered an “ouch?”</p> \\n<p> While investors worried about Apple not growing anymore, rumors began to circulate that the company was working on a $99 iPhone. As iPhone 5 sales were beginning to drop, many investors saw enormous potential in the idea of an <a href=\"http://www.cultofmac.com/209436/apple-already-in-carrier-talks-over-its-budget-iphone-which-will-cost-around-99-rumor/\">unsubsidized $99 iPhone</a>. The WSJ said it would be released by the end of 2013, but when Apple finally announced the iPhone 5c in the Fall the price tag was more than fans were hoping for.</p> \\n<p> China became a huge focus for Apple in 2013 with Tim Cook making his <a href=\"Tim Cook has kicked off 2013 with a second visit to China. The Apple CEO met with Miao Wei, head of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, to discuss the development of China’s information technology industry, mobile communications, and Apple’s expansion in China.

The iWatch will presumably use Bluetooth 4.0 to connect with an iPhone and show incoming messages to act as a bridge between your devices, though we haven’t heard anything official from Cupertino on it yet.&nbsp;</p> \\n<p>Debate surrounding Apple’s stock intensified in February thanks to Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn who demanded Apple <a href=\"http://www.cultofmac.com/217009/greenlight-capital-wants-apple-to-start-selling-ipref-stock/\">start selling iPref stock</a>&nbsp;and even went so far as <a href=\"http://www.cultofmac.com/215422/apple-to-respond-to-greenlight-capital-suit-this-coming-wednesday-report/\">suing the company</a>.</p> \\n<p>Einhorn’s plan called for Apple should distribute $47 billion in preferred&nbsp;stock to fixed-income investors, and call it iPrefs. The iPrefs shares would issue 50 cents per quarter in dividends indefinitely so that investors can get higher yields out of Apple’s stock and get a piece of the more than $100 billion in cash Apple has in the bank. <a href=\"http://www.cultofmac.com/215475/tim-cook-controversy-of-preferred-stock-is-silly-sideshow/\">Tim Cook denounced</a> the entire episode as “a silly sideshow” while speaking at Goldman Sach’s annual tech conference.</p> \\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.cultofmac.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/jonyivecars.jpg\"></a></p> \\n<p>Word of Jony Ive’s growing influence at Apple started to buzz as iWatch rumors grew along with a big iOS 7 redesign in the pipeline. As the new Human Interface designer, Ive planned to apply his hardware design philosophies to software by stripping iOS down to flat, modern, white spaces. The absence of Forstall also led <a href=\"http://www.cultofmac.com/220725/wsj-jony-ives-design-sense-influence-felt-in-new-apple-management-dynamic/\">improved collaboration</a> between Ive and human interface lead Greg Christie, known for his bluntness, with insiders describing the relationship as “pleasant and cordial.”</p> \\n<p>Apple’s mapping efforts were the butt of all the tech jokes toward the end of 2012 thanks to the disastrous launch of its new maps app in iOS 6. &nbsp;Looking to quickly make up lost ground, Apple acquired WifiSlam, an indoor mapping company that developed ways&nbsp;for mobile apps to detect a phone user’s location in a building using Wi-Fi signals, paving the way for iBeacons to launch in iOS 7 later in the year.</p> \\n<p> Controversy surrounding cell phone unlocking came into the national spotlight thanks to a petition with 114,000+ signatures demanding the ability to unlock their iPhone without risking criminal penalties. President Obama came out <a href=\"http://www.cultofmac.com/218272/white-house-says-cell-phone-unlocking-should-be-legalized/\">in favor of legalizing unlocking </a>and released a statement claiming consumers should be able to use their iPhones on another network if the devices has been paid for and the consumer&nbsp;and isn’t bound by a service agreement or other obligation.</p> \\n<p>Rumors of Apple’s <a href=\"http://www.cultofmac.com/221673/apple-pushing-hard-for-summer-iradio-launch-rumor/\">plan for iTunes Radio </a>started heating up alongside whispers that the iPhone 5s will have a <a href=\"http://www.cultofmac.com/219221/the-iphone-5s-will-have-a-fingerprint-sensor-and-nfc-rumor/\">fingerprint sensor</a>.&nbsp;Samsung revealed its answer for the iPhone 5 with the Galaxy S 4 and all its<a href=\"http://www.cultofandroid.com/24216/the-samsung-galaxy-siv-all-tell-but-nothing-to-show-opinion/\"> gimmicky features</a>, but Apple still managed to capture its <a href=\"http://www.cultofmac.com/220854/apple-sends-out-email-to-brag-about-ninth-straight-j-d-power-and-associates-award/\">9th straight J.D.

The update featured big improvements to Safari, notifications, Maps for OS X, and iCloud keychain.</p> \\n<p>MacBook Airs were also shown off at WWDC with all-day battery life thanks to Intel’s new Haswell processors. The new machines featured 2X GPU execution units 40% faster graphics and 45% faster SSDs.

All companies denied involvement in PRISM initial, but by July&nbsp;Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter and others formed a broad alliance with civil liberties groups to demand for increased transparency regarding the U.S. government’s spy programs on citizens.</p> \\n<p>Apple unveiled a <a href=\"http://www.cultofmac.com/235853/apple-announces-logic-pro-x-with-new-features-ipad-controls/\">redesigned Logic Pro X </a>at the end of the month and it also managed to work out a settlement with Amazon over the use of the phrase “App store” before their trial went to court.

       "  'text': '(Tuesday Market Open) For a market nearing all-time highs, volatility remains curiously elevated. The message, in a slow news cycle like the one we’re currently in, could be that one tweet or statement has the chance to set things in a bad way quickly, especially considering how far the market has recently rallied. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) did drop slightly early Tuesday, but stayed above 15.5. Compare that to where VIX was a couple of months ago at around 12, and it seems evident that VIX is hanging in there. It’s actually not too far under early June highs of 18. Typically, a stronger VIX is associated with falling stock prices, but the S&P 500 Index (SPX) closed Monday just 2% below its all-time high of 2954 and up 5% from recent lows. Current volatility levels could signal that some investors might still want to set aside funds to deal with any possible return to risk fears. The trade situation remains uncertain, with threats of more tariffs against China still on the front page. Markets tend to shy from uncertainty. Despite the volatility and the unresolved trade battle, the lights lit up green again on Wall Street in pre-market trading Tuesday, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) is up six days in a row. One thing to consider watching is whether the SPX can close above psychological resistance at 2900, a level it briefly eclipsed Monday before falling back. Inflation data early Tuesday looked like a mixed bag. The headline Producer Price Index (PPI) for May rose 0.1%, in line with analysts’ estimates and down from 0.2% the previous month. That seems pretty benign.\\xa0 However, a producer prices measure excluding food, energy and trade services rose a solid 0.4%. While that beat expectations, it reflected growth in the volatile services category, the Labor Department said, including prices of hotel rooms and hospital care. That could be a transient number, so we’ll see if it remains an issue in June. The consumer price index for May is due out early tomorrow and likely to get a close look from investors for any signs of percolating inflation. Another Helping of Risk The “risk-off” mentality carried into the new week Monday, though stocks couldn’t keep up their solid early gains. Still, all the major indices finished higher, led by cyclical sectors like Info Tech, Consumer Discretionary and Financials. The strength in cyclicals could be partly due to current low rates and hopes for another rate cut in the coming weeks. Generally, so-called “growth” names tend to be more likely to borrow. Meanwhile, some of the “defensive” sectors like Utilities and Staples finished flat to lower, and gold and Treasuries also began pulling back from recent highs. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which looked like it might be ready to test 2% late last week, popped back up to 2.14% on Monday. That’s still way below the 2.68% level where it started the year, so it’s not like the economic uncertainty weighing on rates has gone away. It’s just a little more in the shadows.\\xa0 With the bump in yields, Financials appeared to get a little more traction. We’re four weeks out from the start of earnings season, where Financials typically lead things off.\\xa0 It’s easy to say this new risk-on sentiment is all about the suspension of threatened tariffs against Mexico and a more dovish-sounding Fed, and that likely accounts for a good portion of it. That said, the big merger and acquisition announcements over the weekend might also play a role, with some investors perhaps hoping for more. Companies have pretty much played out the stock buyback game. So if they can borrow money at a low interest rate and combine it with cash on hand, that could be a better use of capital for some firms. The Salesforce (CRM) deal to buy Tableau Software (DATA), for instance, adds a whole new area to CRM’s business. Looking Ahead to Next Trade Talks With the focus on M&A, tariffs took a back seat to start the week. However, it might be a quick drop back followed by a run up the middle. That’s because the G-20 summit in Japan looms at the end of June, and President Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on more Chinese goods if Chinese President Xi doesn’t attend. The countdown to this meeting could start making people nervous in coming weeks. You can’t completely ignore trade, but in the long-term, earnings are what drive the market. It comes back to what’s really going on at the individual companies whose stocks long-term investors own. If you’re a long-term investor, what did the CEOs of your companies say in their last earnings conference calls? Did they mention tariffs? If they’re not worried about tariffs, then maybe it’s worth considering your own concerns. That’s not to say CEOs aren’t worried—many are. However, some companies could see far more impact than others. For the long-term investor, it might be worth thinking about trying to ignore all the daily back-and-forth and staying with your long-term plan and time frame, unless something materially changes with any of the specific companies whose stock you might own.\\xa0 Anyone trying to keep up with this market’s quick moves could get frustrated. A week ago, the Nasdaq (COMP) briefly had a 10% correction, and then rallied. Rebounds are coming more quickly than they used to. COMP continued to outpace other indices Monday, rising more than 1% as the semiconductor world had another strong day. Info Tech sector leaders Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) also had good days, as did Amazon (AMZN). Buying Slows At Monday’s Highs\\xa0 That doesn’t mean the skies are necessarily clear. Until there’s some resolution to the tariff situation, it’s conceivable that the market as a whole could continue to bounce back and forth in its current trading range between roughly 2750 and 2900 for the SPX. One interesting take-away Monday was the SPX’s failure to close above psychological resistance at the 2900 level after eclipsing it intraday. It looks like thin air above 2900, which the SPX has topped for brief periods twice in the last year only to quickly retreat. Besides M&A, corporate news is a bit thin this week. We do get earnings from lululemon (LULU) after the close on Wednesday, however. Fed news could also be sparse, with Fed officials now in the silent period ahead of next week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Some analysts are projecting aggressive moves by the Fed to chop rates, but it’s informative that odds of a June Fed rate cut dwindled in the futures market after President Trump pulled immediate tariffs on Mexico off the table. The futures market is strongly implying a single 25-basis-point easing in July and two more before year-end. Though many investors appear to view a possible rate cut as bullish, remember it would likely reflect the Fed sensing economic weakness. That’s why some analysts continue to be skeptical about this quick rebound in stocks amid soft data.\\xa0 Energy Dive:It can often be a warning sign of weakness in the economy when crude goes soft, the way it did for a couple of weeks before last week’s late rally. U.S. crude seems to be stabilizing above $53 a barrel, but that’s still well below the April high for the year of above $66 and last fall’s high above $76. It’s also not far above recent five-month lows just above $50. There was an interesting graphic in USA Today last week showing renewables gaining on fossil fuels. This doesn’t necessarily have a huge impact on crude, considering crude still runs most of the world’s cars and trucks, not to mention that battery-powered planes don’t appear to be on anyone’s close horizon. However, the move to renewables for power generation could mean hard times for crude’s cousin, natural gas, as wind and solar are becoming more price-competitive vs. natural gas in the electricity markets. If you haven’t looked lately, natural gas futures are really struggling, with the front-month contract recently falling to a three-year low. Cheaper natural gas could give consumers a break as they cool their homes this summer, perhaps putting more money in their pockets for other purchases. Believe It Or Not: Earnings Season Approaching:The start of Q2 earnings is just over a month away, but that doesn’t mean it’s too early to start thinking about what type of results companies might deliver. In Q1, S&P 500 earnings fell 0.4%, according to FactSet, the first quarterly decline since Q2 2016. On the plus side, 76% of companies came in above analysts’ earnings per share estimates, above the five-year average of 72%. Health Care was the best sector performer with 9% growth.\\xa0 In a worrisome sign, 86 S&P 500 companies have issued negative EPS guidance for Q2. FactSet said. It’s still early, but S&P Global Market Intelligence says it sees Q2 EPS falling 1.1%. We’ll see if those estimates change, but the pattern in recent years is for companies to beat early analyst projections. If earnings fall two quarters in a row, we’ll have what’s called an “earnings recession” on our hands, something that hasn’t happened since the 2015/2016 timeframe. Two of a Kind:Arguably the most important two data points this week come Wednesday and Friday with the consumer price index (CPI) for May and retail sales for May. If the soft jobs report and recent tepid manufacturing data reflect a slowing economy, one might expect similar softness to show up with the inflation and retail sales numbers. Analysts expect a 0.1% rise in headline CPI, according to Briefing.com, and a 0.2% rise in core CPI. Headline and core were 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively, in April. If numbers come in light, it could raise more concerns about consumer activity. The same could be said for retail sales, which have fallen in two of the last three monthly reports. They were down 0.2% in April, but analysts expect a big May comeback with 0.7% growth, according to Briefing.com. Some of the pressure in the April report came from weak automobile sales, and excluding those, core retail sales actually rose slightly. However, the jobs report means consumer health is going to probably get a closer look, so any weakness in retail sales might have more market\\xa0 impact than normal, especially on sectors like Consumer Discretionary and Info Tech.

       "  'text': 'Somehow, the second quarter of 2019 has come to an end and the year is now half way over. It also appears that the snap-back rally after the “Sell in May and Go Away” pressure abated and generated the best monthly June performance for stocks since 1938. The economy didn’t even feel hot in June’s numbers at all, but then again the market is now hoping for a Federal Reserve rate cut or two by Jerome Powell. And in the macroeconomic picture, Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping have just massively dialed down their trade rhetoric by halting new tariffs, resuming trade talks, and even allowing U.S. tech companies to sell back into China and to Huawei. Russia and Saudi Arabia have also reached a deal to cut oil production for six months ahead of the coming OPEC meeting. 24/7 Wall St. wanted to bring a recap of the week of June 28, 2019 via top news that we tracked and by bringing the most recent stock market predictions and analyst calls looking ahead. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 14% and the S&P 500 is up 17.3%. The tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite was last seen up 20.6% year-to-date. Gold is up about 9% this year and $58 per barrel crude oil is still up about 16% after the strong June recovery and despite selling off so much from the $66 or so highs. With Friday marking the last day of the second quarter, whatever benchmarking is done will reflect Friday’s closing prices for the second quarter performance metrics. There were some oddball trading volume spikes on Friday with the flurry of stocks being added into or deleted from the annual Russell 1000, 2000 and 3000 rebalances (it creates billions of dollars worth of inflows and outflows each year). Regardless of the China and oil seeing temporary resolutions, economists and investors alike better be braced for some rather lackluster gross domestic product (GDP) numbers for the second quarter. That figure will not be seen for another four weeks, but the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecasting tool went down to just 1.5% GDP growth for Q2 on June 28 from a prior 1.9% forecast just 2 days earlier and down from 2.1% just a week earlier. The New York Fed’s ‘Nowcast’ has been weaker than the Atlanta Fed model, and it ticked down to just 1.3% GDP growth for Q2 on June 28 from 2.2% back in early May. We have seen much less robust economic readings in June and there are likely to be more weak retail spending trends for June, and we have to consider that consumer spending makes up about 70% of GDP. Also hurting or coinciding with weaker Q2 GDP expectations, The overall earnings trend of major companies seems weak with most investors hoping on trade resolutions and a Fed/Powell rate cut at the July FOMC meeting. Before we get into the top news of the week and the analyst calls and forecasting for the second half of 2019 and into 2020, there are some companies holding the Dow back handily. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ: WBA) is the worst performing Dow stock with a 20% drop year-to date, but its earnings is signaling that perhaps a bottom is in. The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) would seem to be the biggest harm on the Dow with software issues increasing around the 737 MAX and going outside of the MAX program (Boeing now may get very few deliveries if an at all the rest of 2019) – but it’s still up over 12% this year. 3M Co. (NYSE: MMM) is also a big drag with a 9% drop this year, but even this troubled conglomerate has bounced 8% from its lows. UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE: UNH) is also a lag with a 2% drop this year due to more concerns about the “Medicare for All” pressure coming from the presidential election challengers for 2020. Now it is time to look forward for the rest of 2019 and into 2020 for Wall Street investing ideas. Friday’s Top Analyst Upgrades and Downgrades were in shares of Aerojet Rocketdyne, Apple, Baidu, Biogen, Chesapeake Energy, Chipotle. McDonald’s, Nike, Procter & Gamble, Walgreens and many more. Thursday’s Top Analyst Upgrades and Downgrades were in shares of AMD, CenturyLink, Delphi, GM, Ford, Intel, KB Home, Micron, Nordstrom, Nvidia, Tesla, Zscaler and more. Wednesday’s top analyst calls were in shares of AbbVie, ADM, ConocoPhillips, Eiger Bio, FedEx, Fox, Kinder Morgan, Lennar, Micron, Slack, Virtu and many more. Apple Set to be a China Beneficiary Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is likely to be up handily of the China trade and nationalism risks are truly being eliminated (or delayed. That said, the unexpected departure of Apple’s to design head Jony Ive just knocked off billions of dollars from Apple’s value. Apple closed down 0.9% at $197.92 on Friday, and some investors and market pundits have suggested that an outright end of China trade woes could add $15 to $20 per share on the stock. Even that wouldn’t get Apple back to its 52-week high of $233.47 and Apple still faces some domestic issues here in the USA as its iPhone cycle has matured and as it tries to get deeper into services and ecosystem revenues. That said, here is a very plain and simple reason we think Tim Cook and his team have been negligent when it comes to its all-in bet with Foxconn and China manufacturing. Banks Score a Huge Win The Federal Reserve’s 2019 CCAR stress tests that allow top bank capital spending plans went off with flying colors on Thursday night. JPMorgan Chase & Company (NYSE: JPM) rose 2.7% to $111.80 on Friday after getting the Fed’s greenlight, and that is still down about 7% from its 52-week high. Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC) even rose 2.2% to $47.32 on its capital outlays to investors getting approval. It turns out that Wells Fargo shares would have to rally over 25% just to hit their 52-week highs. Of the top 10 banks tracked by 24/7 Wall St., investors are going to see as much as $125 billion worth of stock buybacks over the next 12 months and investors are also going to collect $42 billion in bank stock dividends at the same time. High-Yield Dividends & Recessions We will not try to be the idiot who tells our readers that all stocks will hold up fine if that recession warning gets louder, and the reality is that a real recession in the wake of a trade truce probably just got delayed even further. Still, as long as the next downturn isn’t a disaster like a decade ago then the 6% yield of AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) and the 6% yield of Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) looks safe. Wells Fargo even told its clients this week, maybe even the fake accounts, to chase that 9% dividend yield from CenturyLink Inc. (NYSE: CTL) and its shares rallied handily on the call. Safety & Value If you still insist on worrying that a recession is closer than we and many others are calling on, here are 5 value stocks that Goldman Sachs is telling its rich clients and institutional clients to buy for safety. Credit Suisse even called Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) as both being too cheap to ignore despite industry headwinds after “peak auto” continues. Speculative Analyst Stock Picks (Some Very Speculative) Analysts have 5 stocks under $10 with massive implied upside from this last week’s worth of coverage. Friday’s small cap biotech pick of the day was in Avid Bioservices, Inc. (NASDAQ: CDMO) after a 40% gain that was not anywhere close to a 52-week high and which occurred on about 25-times normal trading volume. Avid shares could still double if this analyst upgrade proves to be right. If you think the housing boom is ready to come back, one firm remains cautious about the sector but sees 4 top homebuilders having huge upside ahead. Jefferies sees some top growth stocks to buy for the rest of 2019, and all of them have upcoming catalysts expected to drive their shares higher. Technology Lovers and Haters IPO Glory Days Are Back Used luxury clothing and accessories galore, and maybe even some knock-offs, took shares of The RealReal, Inc. (NASDAQ: REAL) up about 45% to $28.90 and almost 20 million shares traded hands on the first day. One biotech even magically doubled on its hot IPO. Looking Onward & Outwards on Treasuries There are some additional concerns for the U.S. and international markets to contend with. On top of global growth continuing to remain pressured, bond yields are low enough again that it is frightening some investors. The Treasury’s yield of 1.75% on the 2-year note implies that Jerome Powell and the FOMC are at least 2 rate-cuts behind the curve with Fed Funds still in a target of 2.25% to 2.50% — and Goldman Sachs’ Marcus and others have already lowered their own deposit rates ahead of the Fed’s actions. Still, Treasury yields of just 2.00% on the 10-year and 2.52% on the 30-year are concerning. Those yields are likely to rise again on Monday, but this last week we saw a Societe Generale fixed income strategy report predicting that the 10-year Treasury will end 2019 at 1.70% and will dribble even lower to 1.50% by mid-2020. Soc-Gen also sees Fed rate cuts in July and September just being the start with a total of 5 rate cuts (of 25 basis points) by the end of 2020. That is NOT encouraging for the domestic and global growth story, even if it would be supportive for stock valuations. Crypto-Schmipto “Currencies” and Bitcoin This may bring out the crypto-loving and crypto-hating trolls in droves, but that’s life. The crypto-bulls will say “yeah but it doubled off its lows!” here and that fact is impossible to deny. That said, bitcoin peaked at almost $14,000 this week but ended the week down under $12,000 and traded as low as just under $10,500 in between that peak and the weekly close. Let’s just all agree that this is not how a real currency or commodity acts (not even in Venezuela on a 72-hour period). Trying to justify the daily trading moves here on fundamentals, technicals, and even traditional inflows and outflows is just not possible. Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) may still have upside from its Libra if it is launched, but Facebook is also said to be launching it but then stepping away and letting it run on its own. Even Minn. Fed President Neel Kashkari, who is younger and supposed to be the “more hip” Fed-head doesn’t really get how Libra will work. As of Friday, here is a sector glance for year-to-date gains and losses in dollar terms for the top market sectors and for international ETFs outside of the U.S. These year-to-date gains are as follows: Get ready for a choppy work week ahead with the 4th of July on Thursday and everyone taking a fake sick day on Friday (although we gave our whole team the day off for next Friday for a super-long weekend). It’s going to be a short week for sure, but Friday is the unemployment reading and payrolls report that may move the markets but may not ever be seen by most of Americans as they will be out of pocket.

Apple has been under the cloud of this trade war for the last few months, with much of their production and supply chain based in China. Mnuchin’s said that a US/China trade deal was “90 percent” complete, and he believes that “there’s a path to complete this” at the G20 Summit in Japan this week when Donald Trump and Xi Jinping meet. Last week, Apple formally displayed its displeasure with the geopolitical situation when it formally asked the US government to not accelerate its tariffs on goods made in China. They also told the US Trade Representative that the government’s actions would hurt its global competitiveness. One month ago, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote that there is a 29% downside risk to Apple’s earnings due to the possibility of the US/China trade war escalating further. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives believes that Wall Street has priced in Apple’s worst-case scenario with this trade-war, and after these positive comments he maintains his Outperform rating on the stock, with a $235 price target. (To watch Ives' track record, click here) Ives believes that continued tariffs could reduce earnings by 10% to 15% over the next few years, but the seemingly strong possibility this overhang is removed is a fantastic sign for the tech giant and its investors. How much upside does Ives foresee in the stock if everything goes well? Ives thinks that “a resolution to the China tariff situation could add between $20-$25 per share to Apple's stock over the coming months.” This is due to the margin increases from the tariff reduction for phones sold in the US, and the significant importance of the Chinese market to Apple going forward with a saturated US market that has grinded iPhone sales growth to a standstill.

       "  'language': 'en',\n",
       "  'text': 'Apple (AAPL) announced yesterday that Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer, will depart from the company to form an independent design company called LoveFrom with Apple as one of its primary clients. Ive has worked at Apple since 1992 and worked on a variety of projects, including the iMac, iPhone, and most recent Apple Park, Apple’s new headquarters. Ive has held the title of chief design officer (CDO) since 2015, and no successor to that role was immediately named. Wedbush’s Daniel Ives commented, “Our initial take is this move by Ive is a “surprise to the Street” as it is a major changing of the guard within Cupertino. Ive is leaving a hole in the company and is clearly irreplaceable as he has been one of the most important figures at Apple throughout the past few decades; from his iMac vision to the stunning iPhone launch and transformation his fingerprints are deeply woven within Apple’s core DNA. The major question now going forward is around future product innovation with one of the key visionaries of the Apple brand gone.” “In our opinion this news only adds to the current agita around the Apple story as the company is branching out into television and gaming all while it is currently the poster child for the US/ China UFC trade battle on the heels of the G20 summit. While this is a bit if a shocker to Apple and its investors we are not overly concerned as Ive will continue to work closely with Cook & Co. We continue to believe the risk/reward in Apple’s shares is compelling at current levels and also view this name as the most safe from antitrust swirls vs. some of its FAANG brethren with the Beltway now putting a brighter spotlight on big tech stalwarts,” Ives added. Ives reiterates an Outperform rating on Apple stock, with a $235 price target, which implies nearly 19% upside from current levels. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here) Tech expert Gene Munster actually believes the news of Jony Ive leaving Apple came as no surprise, as he has been less involved in products over the past four years. Munster points out that “Apple is using Ive’s departure as an opportunity to elevate Jeff Williams’ role instead of prioritizing clear design leadership. We believe this is an early step toward Tim Cook laying the groundwork for his succession plan, which is five to ten years away. Having the design team report to Williams fulfills a prerequisite for eventually assuming the CEO role.” Overall, Wall Street sizes up AAPL as a ‘Moderate Buy’ stock, as the bulls edge out the cautious on the tech giant. In the last 3 months, Apple stock has received 19 bullish ratings versus 15 analysts hedging their bets, and only two bears who bet heavily against the stock. The 12-month average price target of $212.90 reflects an upside potential of nearly 8%. (See AAPL’s price targets and analyst ratings on TipRanks) \\xa0',\n",

       "  'text': 'Shorts are in for summer. As the S&P 500 hits a fresh series of new record highs, traders are ramping up positions set to profit from share declines in some of the market’s most popular companies. The likes of Tesla, Netflix, and more are attracting such wagers. So-called short sellers bet against shares – and make a profit – by borrowing them from investors who own them, selling them at the market price, and waiting for them to decline before purchasing them back to return to the owner. The higher the short interest is, the more money these traders have in play. That said, holding a short position on a stock can be extremely expensive and risky. If a stock makes significant gains, short sellers can get squeezed by loss – which meanas they have to buy the shares back for more than they originally paid. And that’s on top of the interest spent holding an open position. It also must be noted, however, that not all short interest implies a directionally bearish bet on a stock. As financial-analytics firm S3 Partners has pointed out, shorts on long-term market juggernauts like Facebook and Amazon are also frequently used as market-wide downside hedges. The thinking there is that – since the overall market’s direction is so dictated by these heavily weighted companies – it makes sense to purchase a safety net on the individual stocks to avoid broader losses. In recent months, as the IPO market has caught fire, some of the best-performing newly public stocks have attracted the interest of short sellers. That includes companies like Beyond Meat, which is up 550% since hitting the market. The situation has gotten so extreme that the company’s shares are often more expensive to borrow than they are to own – a rare situation. Even as borrow fees push higher, there’s not yet been any sign of shorts exiting the trade. With all of that established, here are the stocks with the largest notional short interest at present time, ranked in increasing order. All data provided by S3 Partners.

       "  'language': 'en',\n",
       "  'text': \"Apple (AAPL) shares slipped on Thursday as\\xa0Jony Ive announced Wednesday his decision to leave the tech giant later this year. The departure of the company’s long-time chief design officer sparked mixed reactions from investors. “The reality is, next to Jobs, no one had more of an influence in building the iconic Apple brand than Jony,” Wedbush Securities Equity Research Managing Director Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance. “It definitely leaves a major void in terms of innovation in Cupertino.” When speaking to investors, Ives explained the key concern for investors is innovation going forward, “the question is what the next step is. It puts more pressure on Cook and Apple to be successful in services.” Ive’s biggest achievement was the iPhone design. A majority of Apple’s profits and revenue for the next five to eight years will still stem from iPhone sales, said Ives, noting that even though services is becoming more important and “the linchpin to Apple’s valuation and growth going forward... They need to continue to put a fence around their backyard in terms of hardware innovation.” Hardware is critical right now “in terms of the one-two punch with services,” especially with the introduction of 5G, said Ives. “Now they’re doing it without the pilot on the plane, in terms of Jony.” D.A. Davidson Senior Research Analyst Tom Forte believes Ive’s departure isn’t going to be too damaging to Apple. Ive’s departure is less impactful than it would have been five or 10 years ago, Forte told Yahoo Finance. “Apple's working on becoming less dependent on the smartphone. They're working on getting heavier into content, into advertising, into services.” Forte believes Apple is at a “pivot point,” as it branches out to more services and the tech giant has what it takes to go into the next era “even with, potentially, this transition for Jony Ive to a consultant from employee.” (Apple will be Ive’s new design company’s first client.) When it comes to competition in the services space, Forte believes it’s a multi-pronged approach for Apple. Forte explained to Yahoo Finance that rather than trying to find a new product or service that will replace their smartphones, the tech giant will focus on other initiatives. “I look at content. I look at health care. I think that collectively, that can enable Apple to sustain sales growth, despite the maturity of the smartphone category,” he said. “And content will play a role there. But again, part of a consolidated effort.” Taylor Locke is a producer for Yahoo Finance. You can follow her on Twitter@itstaylorlocke.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Shorts are in for summer. As the S&P 500 hits a fresh series of new record highs, traders are ramping up positions set to profit from share declines in some of the market’s most popular companies. The likes of Tesla,Netflix, and more are attracting such wagers. So-called short sellers bet against shares – and make a profit – by borrowing them from investors who own them, selling them at the market price, and waiting for them to decline before purchasing them back to return to the owner. The higher the short interest is, the more money these traders have in play. That said, holding a short position on a stock can be extremely expensive and risky. If a stock makes significant gains, short sellers can get squeezed by loss – which meanas they have to buy the shares back for more than they originally paid. And that’s on top of the interest spent holding an open position. It also must be noted, however, that not all short interest implies a directionally bearish bet on a stock. As financial-analytics firm S3 Partners has pointed out, shorts on long-term market juggernauts like Facebook and Amazon are also frequently used as market-wide downside hedges. The thinking there is that – since the overall market’s direction is so dictated by these heavily weighted companies – it makes sense to purchase a safety net on the individual stocks to avoid broader losses. In recent months, as the IPO market has caught fire, some of the best-performing newly public stocks have attracted the interest of short sellers. That includes companies like Beyond Meat, which is up 550% since hitting the market. The situation has gotten so extreme that the company’s shares are often more expensive to borrow than they are to own – a rare situation. Even as borrow fees push higher, there’s not yet been any sign of shorts exiting the trade.
